# COViD19 Canadian Stats
A react-native app to interactively see the number of CoViD-19 cases in each Canadian province, as well as a history.

## Attributions
I take no credit for anything in this app. The embed is an iframe of https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/iframe/map.html from the Government of Canada. Everything else including react and webview was copy-pastaed from stack overflow answers and official documentation. Of course, none of this would have been possible without the help and direction from my good friend and professional react-native developer, [penguin](https://github.com/Seshpenguin)
